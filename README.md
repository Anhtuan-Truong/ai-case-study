## Overview and Origin

* IBM Medtronic

* When was the company incorporated?
June 22, 2018 - Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT), the global leader in medical technology, services, and solutions, and its strategic technology partner, IBM (NYSE:IBM) Watson Health, today announced commercial availability of the Sugar.IQ(TM) smart diabetes assistant, a first-of-its-kind intelligent app designed to simplify and improve daily diabetes management.

* Who are the founders of the company?
Earl Bakken, a graduate student in electrical engineering, and his brother-in-law Palmer Hermundslie, an enterprising engineer, started a repair business focused on medical electronics. They named it Medtronic.

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Approximately 30.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with diabetes, with 1.5 million new cases being diagnosed every year. More than 6 million of those impacted use insulin to manage their diabetes. People with diabetes face many daily challenges - managing their condition, understanding medical advice, knowing what to eat and when, the impact of food and activity on sugar levels, and trying to avoid critical glycemic events. The groundbreaking Sugar.IQ smart diabetes assistant leverages artificial intelligence (AI) and analytic technologies from IBM Watson Health to continually analyze how an individual's glucose level responds to their food intake, insulin dosages, daily routines, and other factors, such as information provided by the app user.

## Business Activities

* What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Medtronic and IBM Watson Health leveraged their combined expertise in diabetes, AI, and analytics to develop the Sugar.IQ diabetes assistant. The Sugar.IQ assistant reveals patterns that may be hard to see so that someone with diabetes gains meaningful, personalized insights. These insights show how lifestyle choices, medications, and multiple daily injections impact diabetes management and the time spent with glucose in the target range. The app uses AI and advanced analytics to give users a full picture of their current levels and provides insights and individualized guidance in understanding and managing daily diabetes management decisions, so that people on multiple daily insulin injections have more freedom to enjoy life.

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?
The intended customers are individuals with diabetes, which is a prevalent and costly disease affecting millions of people. The impact of diabetes on society is significant, with annual costs amounting to approximately $600 billion. The company aims to provide a solution that empowers individuals to manage their diabetes more effectively, ultimately improving their quality of life.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Medtronic and IBM Watson Health's utilization of Big Data and the Internet of Things sets them apart from competitors. The Sugar.IQ diabetes assistant captures and monitors data in real-time, providing individuals with meaningful insights and guidance for managing their condition. This real-time data analysis and personalized guidance offer a unique advantage over traditional diabetes management approaches.Below is the revised text with clearer language and corrected errors:
